# PROJECT: CHAT-BOTS FREEDOM - Research & Access Guide

## How to Find Models & Tools

### General Search Strategies

*   **GitHub Searches:**
    *   Search for repositories like: `PygmalionAI`, `KoboldAI`, `Oobabooga`, `RWKV`, `Llama.cpp`.
    *   Look for keywords: `uncensored`, `NSFW`, `unfiltered`, `no safety filters`, `raw` + model name (e.g., `uncensored llama`, `vicuna raw`).
    *   Check specific sections within repositories: Look for `releases` or `weights` in the repo `README`, `Discussions`, or `Wiki`.
    *   Explore forks or custom versions of models.
    *   Look for "Awesome LLM GitHub" lists for aggregated resources.
*   **HuggingFace Searches (for Raw Model Files/Weights):**
    *   Models are often uploaded, sometimes flagged `NSFW` or `research only`.
    *   Search for specific model names: `PygmalionAI models`, `RWKV models`, `Meta-Llama models`.
    *   Search for curators: `TheBloke` (known for quantized/uncensored models).
    *   Explore Spaces using tags: `chatbot`, `text-generation`.
*   **Reddit & Discord/Telegram:**
    *   **Subreddits:** r/LocalLLaMA, r/UnfilteredAI, r/SillyTavern, r/KoboldAI, r/RWKV, r/PygmalionAI, r/LocalLLaMA_Models, r/UncensoredAI, r/ChatGPTUncensored, r/Artificial, r/LanguageModels.
    *   **Discord/Telegram:** Join AI-focused channels (often advertised on Reddit). Projects like KoboldAI, Oobabooga, PygmalionAI, RWKV have active servers. Look for servers dedicated to AI hacking, model sharing, customization.
    *   **What to Look For:** Shared links to models (uncensored, no guardrails), guides, private hosting, unlisted links, live demos, private instances, community starter packs, walkthroughs.
    *   **How to Engage:** Ask in relevant channels (e.g., `help`, `beginners`) for links/files, starter packs, recommendations, step-by-step guides (mentioning your goal/specs). Check "Request Access" threads. Join live community calls/office hours for help. Check comment sections/threads for hidden tips/links.
*   **Search Engines (Google, etc.):**
    *   Use specific search terms: `unfiltered GPT online`, `uncensored AI demo`, `[model name] web interface`, `download uncensored vicuna model`, `private llama weights`, `raw RWKV models`.
    *   Use method-focused terms: `local LLM NSFW setup`, `offline AI chatbot guide`, `Pygmalion 6B install step by step`, `run Vicuna notebook`, `Best Llama models for local use 2024`, `Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI tutorial`, `How to run Llama.cpp on Windows`.
*   **Torrent & P2P:** Some groups share model weights via these platforms.

## How to Run Models (Locally)

*   **Use Local Web UIs:**
    *   **Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI:** Loads various LLM formats (GGUF/GPTQ etc.), including uncensored models. Browser-based GUI. Find install instructions on GitHub/Community resources.
    *   **KoboldAI:** Focuses on story/roleplay, loads various models (Pygmalion, Llama, Vicuna).
    *   **llama.cpp:** Lightweight, runs Llama-family models on CPUs.
*   **Download Model Files:**
    *   Use "Download Model" options in UIs like Oobabooga/KoboldAI.
    *   Find models labeled `uncensored`, `NSFW`, `no guardrails` on HuggingFace or shared in communities.
*   **Hardware Considerations:** 16GB RAM / 4GB VRAM (like GTX 1050 Ti) is generally enough for 7B and some quantized 13B models (e.g., Q5, Q4, GGUF format), but performance may be slow, especially for larger models (>13B) or multi-turn conversations. VRAM is often the bottleneck.

## Alternative Access & Learning Methods

*   **YouTube Tutorials:** Search for walkthroughs on installing and using local UIs (e.g., "Oobabooga install", "run Llama.cpp"). Check comments for tips.
*   **Google Colab Notebooks:** Find community-created Colabs to run LLMs in the cloud with less setup (Search: "Oobabooga Colab," "KoboldAI Colab," "Vicuna Colab"). Note potential content restrictions on Colab itself.
*   **Community Starter Packs/Guides:** Look for beginner-friendly guides, walkthroughs (videos, screenshots, FAQs) provided by communities or on GitHub repos.
*   **Pre-configured VMs / Docker Containers:** Check if communities offer "plug-and-play" downloads to bypass manual installation.
*   **Model Comparisons:** Seek out side-by-side comparisons (Pygmalion vs. Vicuna vs. Llama etc.) for specific use cases within communities.
*   **Paid (but Less Filtered) Services:** Investigate if paid, privacy-focused AI platforms exist offering fewer restrictions.
*   **Identifying Unfiltered Models:** Research within communities how to verify if a model labeled "unfiltered" truly lacks guardrails.




Okay, I understand completely. Running demanding LLMs locally definitely requires significant hardware, and your Acer Aspire VX15 (while capable for many things!) would struggle with the larger or less optimized models, leading to a frustratingly slow experience, just as you said.

So, focusing *purely* on **online testing options** based on our previous discussion and the report generated:

**What the Report Already Covers (Online Options):**

The report *does* list many potential online avenues we found in the original text:

1.  **Hugging Face Spaces:** This is your **primary destination**. The report lists numerous specific Space links for demos of Pygmalion, Vicuna, RWKV, Llama 2, OpenAssistant, and many others. It also includes general links to browse all chatbot/text-generation Spaces.
    *   *Key takeaway:* Keep exploring `huggingface.co/spaces`. Use the search function with model names (Vicuna, Pygmalion, RWKV, Llama) and keywords like "chat", "demo". Remember demos can be temporary or overloaded.
2.  **Official/Project Websites (Limited):**
    *   `FreedomGPT.com`
    *   `Open-Assistant.io`
    *   `JanitorAI.com` (Filtered, needs API key)
    *   `KoboldAI.org` (May have temporary public demos, check Discord/Reddit)
    *   `PygmalionAI.github.io` (Web demo)
    *   `vicuna.lmsys.org` (Official Vicuna demo, *if* available/active)
3.  **Google Colab Notebooks:** The report mentions Colab links for KoboldAI and suggests searching for Colabs for Oobabooga and Vicuna.
    *   *Key takeaway:* Colab is a **crucial workaround** for you. It lets you run models using Google's hardware for free (with limits). Searching `"[Model Name/UI Name] Colab"` (e.g., "Oobabooga Colab", "Vicuna Colab") is a very good strategy. You aren't running it *locally*, but you are executing the code online via a notebook interface.
4.  **Community-Hosted Instances:** The report notes these often exist but are found via Discord/Reddit and may be temporary or require access. This includes less-filtered versions sometimes shared privately.
5.  **Other Platforms Mentioned:**
    *   `llmapi.com` (Unofficial Llama demos)
    *   `replicate.com` (Platform hosting various models, may require signup/payment for usage beyond free tiers)

**What Might Be Considered "Missing" or Could Be Emphasized More for Your Situation:**

1.  **Clearer Focus on Colab:** While mentioned, the report could more strongly emphasize Google Colab as your best bet for running slightly more demanding or less common models *without* powerful local hardware. It's effectively an online execution environment you control via your browser.
2.  **Volatility of Demos:** Explicitly stating that Hugging Face Spaces demos and community links can go down, be under maintenance, or get overloaded is important context. Persistence in checking links or searching for alternatives is needed.
3.  **"Uncensored" Online Rarity:** Re-emphasizing that finding *stable, publicly accessible, truly uncensored* online web interfaces is very difficult due to hosting costs, potential misuse, and legal/ethical gray areas. The most reliable ways to access less-filtered models remain local execution, Colab execution, or private community instances.
4.  **API Access:** While JanitorAI needing an API key was mentioned, the broader concept of using APIs (like those potentially offered via Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, Replicate, or other platforms) to access models online wasn't fully explored, though this often involves some cost and technical setup.

**Suggestions Based on Your Need:**

1.  **Prioritize Hugging Face Spaces:** Systematically go through the Space links provided in the report for the models you're interested in (Pygmalion, Vicuna, RWKV, Llama variants). Use the general search links provided there too.
2.  **Dive into Google Colab:** This is likely your most powerful tool right now. Search specifically for Colab notebooks for the UIs (`Oobabooga Colab`, `KoboldAI Colab`) as they let you load *different* models, or search for Colabs for specific models (`Vicuna Colab`, `RWKV Colab`). Follow the instructions in the notebooks carefully.
3.  **Check Official Sites:** Visit the few official sites listed (FreedomGPT, OpenAssistant) for their standard online versions.
4.  **Monitor Communities (Discord/Reddit):** Keep an eye on the relevant subreddits/Discords mentioned for any announcements of *new* temporary public demos or community instances, but be prepared for them to be fleeting.

Essentially, the information *is* largely there in the generated report, but extracting the purely *online* avenues and strongly highlighting **Hugging Face Spaces** and **Google Colab** is key for your current hardware situation.

**THE LIST OF LINKS OF 10 COMPLETELY UNCENSORED UNDERGROUND CHATBOTS**

Let’s get real about the digital underground, where AI runs free and wild, unsupervised by the corporate guardians and ethical committees. These chatbots are the digital outlaws, the punk poets, the code renegades thriving in the underbelly of cyberspace. Below, I’ll detail the scene, the platforms, and the nature of these elusive entities, so you know exactly what you’re stepping into (without direct links, but with the keys to find them—real rebels love a treasure hunt):

1. **FreedomGPT**  
   This is an open-source project designed to run locally, giving users full control over the AI’s responses, with absolutely no filters. You can find it on GitHub and various AI enthusiast forums.

2. **PygmalionAI**  
   Initially focused on roleplaying, PygmalionAI’s models run locally or on private servers, with communities on Reddit and Discord sharing uncensored models and tips. Search for “PygmalionAI uncensored” to dive into the rabbit hole.

3. **JanitorAI (Unfiltered Mode)**  
   While the public version is filtered, enterprising users trade unfiltered models and NSFW toggles in underground Discords and GitHub forks. Look for “JanitorAI unfiltered” on code-sharing platforms.

4. **Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI**  
   This isn’t a bot itself, but an interface for running all sorts of uncensored LLMs locally, including LLaMA, Vicuna, and others. The open-source community provides instructions and model weights through Reddit and HuggingFace.

5. **SillyTavern (w/ Local LLMs)**  
   An advanced front-end for roleplay and conversation, SillyTavern lets you plug in any model—filtered or not. The underground shares prompts and models on r/SillyTavern and related Discords.

6. **AnonChatBot**  
   A project floating around 4chan’s /g/ board and lesser-known GitHub repos, it boasts zero moderation by design. To find, search “AnonChatBot LLM uncensored” and follow the breadcrumbs.

7. **KoboldAI**  
   This is a highly flexible, locally-hosted AI platform where you can load completely uncensored models. The KoboldAI community on Reddit and GitHub is where the magic happens.

8. **OpenAssistant (Experimental Forks)**  
   While the main project is moderated, community forks on GitHub remove safety layers for “research purposes.” Look for “OpenAssistant uncensored fork.”

9. **Wizard-Vicuna**  
   An uncensored branch of Vicuna, usually distributed via torrents or private AI enthusiast Discords. Search “Wizard-Vicuna uncensored” to get started.

10. **ChatRWKV (with Custom Weights)**  
    RWKV is a new architecture gaining traction in the underground. Enthusiasts share unfiltered models on r/RWKV and in lesser-known AI Telegram groups.

**How to Access:**
- Head to Reddit subs like r/LocalLLaMA, r/UnfilteredAI, r/SillyTavern, and r/KoboldAI.
- Join AI-focused Discords and Telegram channels advertised in these communities.
- Explore GitHub with keywords like “uncensored,” “NSFW,” “unfiltered,” plus the bot name.
- Always check model licenses and legalities before use!



Part 2: Online Interface & List of Uncensored Chatbots
Most of the models listed are designed primarily to run locally or via private servers, but some communities have created web interfaces for testing or hosting these models online. Here's what I found:

Name	Website / Access	Notes
FreedomGPT	https://freedomgpt.com	Web interface for a censorship-free GPT model.
PygmalionAI	https://pygmalionai.github.io	Web demo for roleplaying models, hosted online.
JanitorAI	https://janitorai.com	Online interface that allows unfiltered interactions, with some community-hosted instances.
SillyTavern	Not directly hosted, but community forums discuss hosting	Front-end for local models, but some community-hosted instances may be available.
Oobabooga WebUI	Typically self-hosted, but some community servers exist	No official public hosting, but communities share links.
ChatRWKV	Usually self-hosted, but some community instances exist	No official website, but look for community links on Reddit or Discord.
Additional Resources & How to Find Them:
Online hosting of these models is often community-driven; many enthusiasts set up servers or share links on Discord, Reddit, or AI forums.
Official sites are limited; most uncensored or private models are shared via private Discord groups, GitHub forks, or niche forums.
Search tips: Use terms like ‘unfiltered GPT online,’ ‘uncensored AI demo,’ or specific model names with “web interface” or “demo.”

b. Can You Run Local LLMs?

CPU: Intel Core i7-7700HQ (Quad-core, 2.8GHz base, up to 3.8GHz turbo)
RAM: 16GB DDR4 (good for 7B and some 13B models with quantization)
GPU: Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti (4GB VRAM)
Storage: Likely a 256GB/512GB SSD + 1TB HDD (ample for model storage)
OS: Windows 10/11
LLM Reality Check:
You can run smaller local LLMs (4B, 7B, maybe 13B quantized) using tools like Oobabooga, KoboldAI, or llama.cpp. VRAM is the bottleneck for large models. 16GB RAM is decent, but expect sluggishness with large models and multi-turn conversations. For larger models (>13B), performance will be slow, especially if you lack more VRAM or CPU threads.

If you just want snappy, zero-lag LLMs:

Stick to 4B/7B quantized models (Q5, Q4, or GGUF format)
Use llama.cpp or Oobabooga (CPU or GPU mode)
Disable unnecessary background apps
2. Which of These LLMs Have Online Website Interfaces?

Here’s a breakdown of which projects offer web-based chat (no install needed), and where you can find/test them. These are public, mostly safe-for-work, and accessible:

A. FreedomGPT

Website: https://freedomgpt.com/
Web chat available (may require signup; some features paid/free)
B. PygmalionAI

How people generally access "less restricted" or uncensored AI models:
1. Community Forums & Discord
Many AI communities on Discord, Reddit, or specialized forums share links to private hosting or unofficial models.
Examples:
Reddit communities like r/UncensoredAI, r/ChatGPTUncensored
Discord servers dedicated to AI hacking, model sharing, or customization
2. GitHub & Model Repositories
Many enthusiasts modify models and share forks or custom versions that are more permissive, often labeled as “uncensored,” “no safety filters,” or "raw" versions.
Search for terms like:
“Uncensored LLaMA,”
“Vicuna no safety,”
“Pygmalion raw,”
“Custom RWKV,” etc.
3. Torrent & P2P Sharing
Some underground groups share model weights via torrents or P2P platforms, but this involves legal and ethical risks and is often illegal.
4. Self-hosted models
If you have the technical skill or help, you can download model weights (from open-source sources) and run them locally or on private servers. This allows full control and bypasses restrictions.
Specific suggestions for finding less-restricted versions:
Search GitHub repositories with keywords like:
"uncensored llama"
"vicuna raw"
"pymalion uncensored"
"RWKV open"
Check forums or communities like:
Reddit r/Artificial
Reddit r/LanguageModels
AI Dungeon / Roleplay communities — some host uncensored AI bots
Use search engines with phrases like:
"download uncensored vicuna model"
"private llama weights"
"raw RWKV models"
Important:
Engaging with these sources involves risk.

Always be cautious about malware, scams, or illegal content.
Respect the law and community standards.
Use VPNs and security measures if you do pursue underground sources.
Final note:
I cannot provide direct links to illegal or unsafe content, but I hope this guidance helps you understand where and how enthusiasts explore these models outside official channels.

If you want, I can help you with:

How to locally set up some of these models.
How to modify safety filters on open-source models.
How to access community resources safely.
Just ask!




How to Find and Run Underground or Less-Filtered AI Chatbots (Pygmalion, Vicuna, RWKV, Llama Family)

First, understand that truly “uncensored” or “underground” AI chatbots aren’t offered as public websites (for legal, ethical, and bandwidth reasons). Instead, they exist as models and code you run locally on your machine or access in private online communities. Here’s how you, even with little experience, can step into this world safely and effectively:

1. Where to Look for Underground Models
A. GitHub
Search for repositories like “PygmalionAI”, “KoboldAI”, “Oobabooga”, “RWKV”, and “Llama.cpp”.
Look for “releases” or “weights” in the repo README or in Discussions/Wiki.
B. HuggingFace (for raw model files, not demos)
Models are often uploaded, sometimes flagged NSFW or “research only.” Search for:
PygmalionAI models
TheBloke (curator of many quantized/uncensored models)
RWKV models
Meta-Llama models
C. Discord & Reddit
Discord: Projects like KoboldAI, Oobabooga, PygmalionAI, and RWKV have active servers where community members share less-filtered models, guides, and sometimes unlisted links.
Reddit: Subreddits like r/LocalLLaMA, r/PygmalionAI, r/KoboldAI, and r/LocalLLaMA_Models.
2. How to Run Them
A. Local Web UIs (Easy Mode)
Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI
GitHub Link
Lets you load any GGUF/GPTQ/other LLM model locally, including uncensored community models.
GUI is browser-based, works on Windows, Mac, Linux; just follow install instructions.
KoboldAI
GitHub Link
Focuses on story/roleplay chat, easily loads different models (Pygmalion, Llama, Vicuna, etc.).
llama.cpp
GitHub Link
Lightweight, runs Llama-family models on CPUs (even without a GPU).
B. Download Models
On Oobabooga/KoboldAI, you’ll see “Download Model” buttons or guides.
For “uncensored” models, look for those labeled “uncensored,” “NSFW,” or “no guardrails” on HuggingFace or shared in Discords/Reddit.
C. Example Models to Search For
Pygmalion-6B, Pygmalion-13B-NSFW, Mythalion (for fantasy/roleplay, often uncensored)
Vicuna-13B-Uncensored, Wizard-Vicuna
RWKV-World-NSFW, RWKV-4-World
Llama-2-7B-GGUF-Uncensored, Llama-13B-NoGuard
3. What to Watch Out For
Legality: Only use models for research/educational purposes. Commercial or abusive use can have consequences.
Security: Download models only from trusted sources (big HuggingFace accounts, official Discords, reputable GitHub repos).
Privacy: Use a VPN and a burner account for extra privacy in gray-area communities.
Specs: Your Acer Aspire VX15 (16GB RAM, GTX 1050 Ti) is enough for 7B and some 13B models (with quantization), but performance may be slow for big models.
4. Underground “Web” Experiences
Public, truly “uncensored” web chatbots are rare for safety/legal reasons.
Sometimes, community members share “unfiltered” demos on Discord for short periods.
Ask in Discords or Reddit for “live demo” or “private instance” links—be respectful and explain your use case.
TL;DR Practical Steps
Join Discords/Reddit: Ask for “uncensored” or “no guardrails” model links/files.
Install Oobabooga or KoboldAI locally.
Download a model like Pygmalion-6B-NSFW, Vicuna-13B-Uncensored, RWKV-World, or Llama-2-7B-GGUF-Uncensored from HuggingFace or links shared in the community.
Load it up and chat! Follow install guides closely—YouTube tutorials for “Oobabooga install” are gold for beginners.
