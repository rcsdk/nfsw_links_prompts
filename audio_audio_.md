### 10 More Audio-to-Audio Roleplay Platforms/Tools
Below are 10 platforms or tools that either directly support audio-to-audio (voice-based) roleplay or have features that could enable it, focusing on AI-driven characters or interactive experiences. I’ve included a brief description for each based on their known capabilities as of March 25, 2025.

### Notes
- **Availability**: Some platforms (e.g., ElevenLabs, Inworld AI) are more developer-focused but can be adapted for personal audio-to-audio roleplay with setup. Others (e.g., RolePlai, Hi.AI) are ready-to-use apps.
- **Voice Features**: Not all offer full duplex audio-to-audio (simultaneous talking/listening) like a phone call—many use voice input with synthesized speech output. Check each site for the latest on voice support, as features evolve.
- **Roleplay Focus**: These were chosen for their potential in character-driven, imaginative audio interactions, aligning with your interest in Talkie.ai and similar tools.
